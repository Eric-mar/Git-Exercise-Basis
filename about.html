    <h1>One of the most significant contributions of animals is
         biodiversity. Different animals help maintain natural 
         processes such as pollination, seed dispersal, and soil fertility. For example, bees pollinate flowers, birds spread
         seeds, and earthworms improve the quality of the soil.</h1>
