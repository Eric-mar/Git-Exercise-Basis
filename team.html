    <h1>Moreover, food has become an art and a form of
         expression. Chefs experiment with ingredients, 
         textures, and flavors to create experiences that go beyond
          satisfying hunger. Today, food is also tied to global issues 
          such as sustainability and climate change. How we grow, prepare, 
          and consume food affects the environment. This is why there is a
           growing movement toward organic farming, reducing 
        food waste, and adopting plant-based diets.</h1>
