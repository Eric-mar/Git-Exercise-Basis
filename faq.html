        For example, sushi in Japan, pasta in Italy,
         or ugali in East Africa are not just meals but 
         symbols of identity and pride. Sharing food is also a
          universal way of bringing people togetherâ€”families gather 
          around the dinner table, festivals are celebrated with special dishes,
         and friendships are strengthened over meals.
